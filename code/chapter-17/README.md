# Code for Chapter 17: Building an Autonomous Car in Under an Hour: Reinforcement Learning with AWS DeepRacer

Moving from the virtual to the physical world, guest author **Sunil Mallya** showcases how AWS DeepRacer, a miniature car, can be assembled, trained and raced in under an hour. And with the help of reinforcement learning, the car learns to drive on its own, penalizing mistakes and maximizing success. We learn how to apply this knowledge to races from the Olympics of AI Driving to RoboRace (using full-sized autonomous cars). Bonus: Hear from **Anima Anandkumar (NVIDIA)** and **Chris Anderson (founder of DIY Robocars)** on where the self-driving automotive industry is headed.
